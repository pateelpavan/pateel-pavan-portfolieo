# Netlify Deployment Guide

Your portfolio website is now properly configured for Netlify deployment!

## What I've Set Up

1. **Fixed Build Configuration**: Updated `netlify.toml` to use the correct build directory (`build` instead of `dist`)
2. **Moved Configuration**: Moved `netlify.toml` to the root directory where Netlify can find it
3. **Verified Build Process**: Tested that `npm run build` works correctly and outputs to the `build` directory

## Current Configuration

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `build`
- **Node Version**: 18
- **Framework**: Vite + React

## How to Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Run `npm run build` in your project directory
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag the `build` folder directly onto the Netlify dashboard
4. Your site will be deployed instantly!

### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Set these build settings in Netlify:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `build`
   - **Node version**: 18
4. Deploy!

### Option 3: Netlify CLI
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

## Build Process

To build your project locally:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `assets/` - CSS and JavaScript files
- All other static assets

## Important Notes

- Your `netlify.toml` file is configured with proper redirects for SPA routing
- Security headers are included for better security
- Asset caching is optimized for performance
- The build process is working correctly and generates the expected output

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Make sure you're in the project root directory
2. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Run `npm run build` to test the build process
4. Check that the `build` directory contains the expected files

Your site is ready for deployment! ðŸš€
